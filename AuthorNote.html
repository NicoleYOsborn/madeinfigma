<strong>Thank you so much for reading!</strong>
<p>If you are here, there is a good chance that these characters have touched your life and sparked your imagination, as they have mine. I write and post these stories for a few reasons.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Because the ideas forced themselves out and I had no choice.</li>
    <li>Because I love the community and friends I have made and want to give back.</li>
    <li>Because I enjoy the challenge of learning a new skill and trying new things.</li>
    <li>Because I crave praise and validation.</li>
</ul>

<p>With that said, I would adore any feedback you are willing to give, be it a kudos, an emoji comment, or a diatribe about how wrong I am about a character. Your point of view is valid, and I'm interested!</p>
