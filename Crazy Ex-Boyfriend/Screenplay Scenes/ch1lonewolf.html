        <p class="act">Dust swirls in the hot breeze as REMUS LUPIN, clad in worn leather, rides into the weathered town on a weary horse. His eyes scan the seemingly abandoned streets.</p>
        
        <p class="trns">CUT TO:</p>
        
        <p class="slug">INT. SALOON - DAY</p>
        
        <p class="act">Remus enters a dimly lit SALOON. The patrons go silent, their eyes locked onto him. A hushed exchange of words ripples through the room.</p>
        
        <p class="char">RANDOM PATRON 1: </p>
        
        <p class="par">(whispers)</p>
        
        <p class="dlog">I think that’s Lone-wolf Lupin, the loneliest sonuvabitch in the West.</p>
        
        <p class="act">Remus disregards the comments, approaches the bar, and orders a whiskey. He carries it to a shadowy BOOTH in the corner.</p>
        
        <p class="act">A few minutes pass, and a STRIKINGLY HANDSOME MAN slides into the booth across from Remus.</p>
        
        <p class="char">THE STRANGER:</p>
        
        <p class="dlog">I hear you’re a traveler.</p>
        
        <p class="char">REMUS LUPIN:</p>
        
        <p class="dlog">That’s right. I’m lookin’ for somethin’ I just haven’t been able to find yet.</p>
        
        <p class="char">THE STRANGER:</p>
        
        <p class="dlog">Might be that we’re lookin’ for the same thing.</p>
        
        <p class="char">REMUS LUPIN:</p>
  
        <p class="dlog">And what’s that?</p>

        <p class="par">(smirking)</p>
        
        <p class="dlog">I’ll know it when I see it. I’m headin’ out west. Maybe you’d like to journey together?</p>
        
        <p class="act">Remus, with a hint of defiance, spits tobacco juice into a SPITTOON.</p>
        
        <p class="char">REMUS LUPIN: </p>
        
        <p class="par">(gruff)</p>
        
        <p class="dlog">Maybe you haven’t heard. I’m a lone wolf. Who are you, anyway?</p>
        
        <p class="act">The stranger flashes a charming grin and refills both their whiskey glasses. He raises his glass.</p>
        
        <p class="char">THE STRANGER:</p>
        
        <p class="par">(confident)</p>
        
        <p class="dlog">They call me The Black Dog. Maybe it’s time you found your pack, Mr. Wolf. I’m headin’ out tomorrow at daybreak. Hope to see you then.</p>
        
        <p class="act">With that, The Black Dog saunters out through the SWINGING DOORS, leaving Remus Lupin in the shadowy embrace of the saloon, contemplating his next move under the relentless Western sun.</p>
