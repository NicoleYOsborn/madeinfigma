        <p class="slug">INT. DINNER PARTY - FLASHBACK</p>

        <p class="act">Remus Lupin is amidst a group of friends at a party at a nice restaurant in a building with large windows overlooking a thriving city. Laughter fills the air as they share precious moments of joy in a world that they all took for granted.</p>

        <p class="act">Sirius stands by Remus, his arm affectionately around his waist. Sirius kisses Remus's temple and returns his attention to a story told by James Potter, who gesticulates wildly.</p>

        <p class="act">SUDDENLY, a blinding FLASH OF LIGHT outside the window steals their attention. Panic ensues as a meteor hurtles toward Earth. The partygoers scramble, rushing towards the exits.</p>

        <p class="par">(to Remus, urgently)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Remus, I want you to go to the basement and lock yourself in. Wait for me, I'll be there as soon as I can.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(concerned)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Sirius, not without you—</p>

        <p class="char">SIRIUS</p>

        <p class="dlog">I promise I'll come back for you. I love you.</p>

        <p class="act">Sirius kisses Remus with fervor before urging him to leave.</p>

        <p class="trns">CUT TO:</p>

        <p class="slug">INT. MAKESHIFT SHELTER - REMUS'S NIGHTMARE - PRESENT</p>

        <p class="act">Remus Lupin awakens, tears streaming down his face, in a shabby shelter within a devastated city. Remus wears tattered, filthy clothes. He stumbles out onto the street, his will to survive hanging by a thread.</p>

        <p class="act">The sky is a reddish-gray hue, and the city that once thrived now lies in ruins.</p>

        <p class="act">Remus rummages through a pile of rubble, his fingers finding a can of food. The label is burned away, but it appears unspoiled. He adds it to a sack he is carrying and presses on.</p>

        <p class="act">As he wanders through the desolation, he hears movement nearby.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(cautiously)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Is someone there?</p>

        <p class="act">A skinny, grimy CHILD steps out from behind a dumpster.</p>

        <p class="char">CHILD</p>

        <p class="par">(pleading)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Please, sir. I need help. Do you have any food? We haven't eaten in days.</p>

        <p class="act">Remus scans the area, suspicious.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="dlog">We? Are there other survivors?</p>

        <p class="char">CHILD</p>

        <p class="par">(pointing)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Just my sister and me.</p>

        <p class="act">Another child quickly peeks out from behind the dumpster.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(considering)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Ah. Well, let me see.</p>

        <p class="act">He opens his pack, revealing the can of food he found.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(gently)</p>

        <p class="dlog">This is all I've found today. Good luck.</p>

        <p class="act">Remus hands the can to the child and turns to continue his lonely journey.</p>

        <p class="char">CHILD</p>

        <p class="par">(persisting)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Sir, don't you want to share it?</p>

        <p class="act">Remus looks back and speaks softly.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="dlog">Nah. It's for you and your sister. You have each other. That’s something to live for. Hold onto that.</p>

        <p class="act">He walks on, further into a bleak landscape. In the distance, the OCEAN stretches out before him. Remus continues toward it, a solitary figure in a world forever changed.</p>
