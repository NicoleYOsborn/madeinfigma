        <p class="slug">INT. STARSHIP BRIDGE - HOGSMEADE - DAY</p>

        <p class="act">The Bridge of the Hogsmeade bears a striking resemblance to the iconic Starship Enterprise, with its sleek design and advanced technology. Remus Lupin, a distinguished executive officer, enters with a sense of reverence.</p>

        <p class="act">Captain Evans, a confident woman with long auburn hair, approaches Lupin, extending a firm handshake.</p>

        <p class="char">EVANS</p>

        <p class="dlog">Commander Lupin. It's such an honor to have you on board for our upcoming journey. I was pleased to receive your request for a transfer.</p>

        <p class="act">Lupin returns the handshake with a warm smile.</p>

        <p class="char">LUPIN</p>

        <p class="dlog">Captain Evans, it is a pleasure. I am the one who is honored and humbled to be working on such a highly regarded ship as The USS Hogsmeade. Please.</p>

        <p class="act">Lupin folds his hands behind his back, after gesturing for Evans to lead the way.</p>

        <p class="act">As they walk, Lupin is introduced to Lieutenant Commander Weasley, the ship's Chief Science Officer, who can hardly contain her excitement.</p>

        <p class="char">WEASLEY</p>

        <p class="dlog">Commander Lupin! I'm a huge fan of your work on the Starship Prophet.</p>

        <p class="act">Lupin graciously acknowledges her praise.</p>

        <p class="act">The ship's Counselor, Lieutenant Tonks, greets him with a cheerful demeanor, suggesting he engage in social activities on the ship and inviting him for tacos after their shift.</p>

        <p class="char">TONKS</p>

        <p class="dlog">You've got to try the ship's tacos, Commander. It's a must!</p>

        <p class="act">Lupin politely agrees to join her for tacos later, before he takes his place in the first officer’s chair, surveying the Bridge.</p>

        <p class="char">EVANS</p>

        <p class="dlog">Lieutenant, set a course for the Leaky Nebula.</p>

        <p class="act">Lt. Weasley raises a concerned eyebrow.</p>

        <p class="char">WEASLEY</p>

        <p class="dlog">The Leaky Nebula? Are you certain, Captain? We don't know what we might find there. It could be hostile territory.</p>

        <p class="act">Lupin leans back in the chair, exuding wisdom.</p>

        <p class="char">LUPIN</p>

        <p class="dlog">Or we could make first contact with another sentient race and change the course of human existence. We are explorers, Lieutenant. We must boldly go where no one has gone before.</p>

        <p class="act">Evans nods in agreement, taking her position in the captain’s chair.</p>

        <p class="char">WEASLEY</p>

        <p class="dlog">I have the coordinates, sir!</p>

        <p class="char">EVANS</p>

        <p class="dlog">Excellent.</p>

        <p class="act">She turns to Lupin with a grin.</p>

        <p class="dlog">Commander, would you like to do the honors?</p>

        <p class="char">LUPIN</p>

        <p class="dlog">Of course, Captain. Engage!</p>

        <p class="act">Lupin waves a hand, and the USS Hogsmeade springs to life as it embarks on its daring journey into the unknown.</p>
