        <p class="slug">INT. ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY</p>

        <p class="sub">(Animated in the style of classic Disney films)</p>

        <p class="act">The sun-dappled forest glows with an otherworldly beauty. Prince Remus Lupin, a handsome but sheltered young man with flowing locks, wears a royal cape as he picks berries, accompanied by his faithful dog, Padfoot. A longing fills his eyes as he gazes beyond the village.</p>

        <p class="char">PRINCE REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(whispering to Padfoot)</p>

        <p class="dlog"> Padfoot, I know there is more to life than this. Some days I wish someone would just come and steal me away.</p>

        <p class="act">Padfoot looks up at Remus with big, concerned puppy eyes, sensing his restlessness.</p>

        <p class="char">PRINCE REMUS</p>

        <p class="dlog">Oh, don't look at me like that. Of course, I would never do anything to put myself in danger.</p>

        <p class="act">Remus continues to pick berries, humming a soft tune. Padfoot's unease grows, and he starts whining, his hair standing on end. He grips Remus's cape with his teeth and tugs.</p>

        <p class="char">PRINCE REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(angry)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Padfoot! What has gotten into you? Oh!</p>

        <p class="act">He looks up and gasps, seeing themselves surrounded by a pack of menacing wolves, eyes gleaming yellow and teeth bared. The basket of berries falls to the ground as Remus tells Padfoot to run. They scramble through the woods in a panic and burst out onto a road, coming to an abrupt halt.</p>

        <p class="act">Before them, a company of gallant Knights on horseback blocks the road. The Prince and Padfoot are startled.</p>

        <p class="char">SIR BLACK</p>

        <p class="par">(from the head of the party, handsome and valiant)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Woah! Who goes there?</p>

        <p class="act">Prince Remus steps forward, panting and out of breath.</p>

        <p class="char">PRINCE REMUS</p>

        <p class="dlog">Wolves! In the forest!</p>

        <p class="act">The Knights turn their gaze toward the forest, witnessing the wolf pack skitter to a stop and retreat upon the sight of these valiant men on magnificent steeds.</p>

        <p class="char">SIR BLACK</p>

        <p class="par">(earnestly)</p>

        <p class="dlog">We seem to have found you just in time. You should know that these woods are unsafe to be traveling alone. I am Sir Black, and these are my knights, Sir James and Sir Peter. Please, allow us to escort you back to the village safely.</p>

        <p class="act">Sir Black extends a hand to help the Prince onto his horse, their eyes meeting in a moment of enchantment.</p>

        <p class="char">PRINCE REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(flabbergasted)</p>

        <p class="dlog">I'm Remus, I'm… er… a baker. In the village. I've never ridden on a horse before.</p>

        <p class="act">Sir Black smiles warmly, their connection undeniable.</p>

        <p class="char">SIR BLACK</p>

        <p class="par">(encouraging)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Don't worry, Remus. You're safe with me. Do you trust me?</p>

        <p class="act">Remus takes Sir Black's hand, and the journey into the unknown world beyond the village begins, filled with magic, adventure, and the promise of true love.</p>
