        <p class="slug">INT. MOONSHADOW'S SECRET LAIR - NIGHT</p>

        <p class="act">Remus Lupin, a brilliant professor, returns home after a grueling day of consulting with world leaders. He's about to enjoy a cup of tea when an emergency signal interrupts his respite. His faithful sidekick, The Matriarch (Molly Weasley), has located his nemesis, Wolfsbane, at the Butterbeer factory. The distress signal blares from a monitor.</p>

        <p class="act">With a long-suffering sigh, Remus presses a hidden button under his table, revealing his superhero costume. It's a sleek black ensemble with a purple cape, proudly displaying three phases of a Lunar Eclipse across the chest.</p>

        <p class="trns">CUT TO:</p>

        <p class="slug">INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT</p>

        <p class="act">Now dressed as Moonshadow, Remus steps into an elevator and ascends to the rooftop of the building. The moonlight bathes him as he stands ready for action. With a raised arm, he silently takes to the sky.</p>

        <p class="trns">CUT TO:</p>

        <p class="slug">EXT. BUTTERBEER FACTORY - NIGHT</p>

        <p class="act">Moonshadow arrives at the giant butterbeer factory on the outskirts of the city, where the distress signal originates.</p>

        <p class="trns">CUT TO:</p>

        <p class="slug">INT. BUTTERBEER FACTORY - NIGHT</p>

        <p class="act">Inside, Moonshadow hears cries for help. He uses his super strength to pry open a steel door and discovers two couples suspended over a boiling vat of liquid. Their ropes are dangerously frayed, hanging over a sharp steel beam.</p>

        <p class="act">The first couple, Lily Evans and James Potter, is in dire straits. Moonshadow communicates with The Matriarch through his earpiece, planning a daring rescue.</p>

        <p class="char">MOONSHADOW</p>

        <p class="par">(urgent)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Molly, can I make it in time?</p>

        <p class="act">The Matriarch analyzes the situation through his eye piece, measuring the temperature.</p>

        <p class="char">THE MATRIARCH</p>

        <p class="par">(concerned)</p>

        <p class="dlog">At those temperatures, your cape won't withstand a second rescue. You can save only one.</p>

        <p class="act">Moonshadow is determined, and he asks The Matriarch to find a way to turn off the boiler while he saves the first couple.</p>

        <p class="act">He flies over to James and Lily, who grab hold of him. Using a knife from his utility belt, he cuts their rope. The hot fumes sap his energy, and his cape wilts. He makes a dramatic dive for a nearby platform, saving them just in time.</p>

        <p class="act">Dorcas and Marlene remain suspended over the vat, their rope fraying dangerously.</p>

        <p class="char">MOONSHADOW</p>

        <p class="dlog">Molly, any luck with the boiler?</p>

        <p class="char">THE MATRIARCH</p>

        <p class="dlog">Yes! There's a control on the other side. If you can get to it, I can guide you to turn off the boiler and close the vat cover!</p>

        <p class="char">MOONSHADOW</p>

        <p class="dlog">There's no time. James, I need your help! Take this, and Molly will tell you what to do!</p>

        <p class="act">Moonshadow hands James the earpiece and begins to climb the rafters. He reaches the fraying rope just in time as it snaps, holding on while enduring the scorching heat and fumes.</p>

        <p class="act">James successfully closes the vat, and Moonshadow uses his repelling hook to lower himself and the two women safely to the platform.</p>

        <p class="char">LILY EVANS</p>

        <p class="par">(relieved)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Thank you, Moonshadow! We owe you our lives!</p>

        <p class="char">MOONSHADOW</p>

        <p class="par">(modest)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Itâ€™s all in a day's work, Ms. Evans.</p>

        <p class="act">An evil laugh echoes over the loudspeaker.</p>

        <p class="char">WOLFSBANE</p>

        <p class="par">(sinister)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Nice job, Moonshadow, but that was just a distraction! I have your lover boy, Sirius Black, on the roof strapped to a bomb. You have 90 seconds to show yourself, or he dies, taking this whole building with him!</p>

        <p class="act">Panic sweeps through the room as everyone looks to Moonshadow for guidance.</p>

        <p class="char">JAMES POTTER</p>

        <p class="par">(tearful)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Sirius! You have to save him, Moonshadow!</p>

        <p class="char">MOONSHADOW</p>

        <p class="dlog">I will, James. I promise. Now, go!</p>

        <p class="act">With a confident shake of his cape, now cool and dry, Moonshadow takes off.</p>

        <p class="trns">CUT TO:</p>

        <p class="slug">EXT. BUTTERBEER FACTORY ROOFTOP - NIGHT</p>

        <p class="act">Moonshadow lands on the roof and sees Sirius tied and gagged, a digital timer counting down from 60 seconds.</p>

        <p class="act">Panicked, Moonshadow fumbles for his earpiece, realizing that The Matriarch is with James, leaving him helpless.</p>

        <p class="act">The villain, Wolfsbane, emerges from the shadows, wearing a wolf's pelt and a mask.</p>

        <p class="char">WOLFSBANE</p>

        <p class="dlog">You sure like to cut it close, Moonshadow! But now that you are here, I want the world to know the truth about who you really are!</p>

        <p class="char">MOONSHADOW</p>

        <p class="par">(calmly)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Whatever you say, Wolfsbane. Let Sirius go, and we can talk this over.</p>

        <p class="act">He notices cameras placed around the rooftop turning to focus on him.</p>

        <p class="char">WOLFSBANE</p>

        <p class="par">(triumphant)</p>

        <p class="dlog">These cameras are broadcasting all over the city! Soon the world will know that you are a fraud, Moonshadow!</p>

        <p class="char">MOONSHADOW</p>

        <p class="dlog">You are the villain here, Wolfsbane. I'm here to take you down!</p>

        <p class="act">Wolfsbane removes his mask, revealing his true identity - Remus Lupin. He tosses the mask aside and spreads his arms, presenting himself to the cameras. Moonshadow stares in shock.</p>

        <p class="act">The timer on the bomb ticks relentlessly toward zero. Sirius looks at Moonshadow with pure hatred and contempt in his eyes.</p>
