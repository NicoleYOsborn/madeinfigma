        <p class="slug">EXT. MIDDLE-EARTH - DIRT ROAD - DAY</p>

        <p class="act">The weary hobbit, RUMBLEUS LUPINHOLLOW, trudges down a dusty dirt road, his clothes tattered and his belly empty. He collapses onto a rock by the roadside, desperation etched on his face. He rummages in his pack, revealing only a few meager crumbs of bread and cheese.</p>

        <p class="char">RUMBLEUS</p>

        <p class="par">(whispering to himself)</p>

        <p class="dlog">If I don't find food and shelter soon, I fear I shall perish.</p>

        <p class="act">In the dim light, he catches a glimmer from an object within his pack.</p>

        <p class="char">RUMBLEUS</p>

        <p class="dlog">The diadem could help me discover a way to save my own life. Its use is forbidden, but what good is a dead hobbit to anyone?</p>

        <p class="act">Driven by necessity, he retrieves a SILVER DIADEM and hastily places it upon his head. Wisdom floods his mind instantly, but something darker gleams in his eyesâ€”a dangerous allure. He quickly removes the diadem and shakes his head, returning to himself. Carefully, he stows it in his pack, his eyes now filled with purpose.</p>

        <p class="act">With newfound determination, he rises, slings his pack over his shoulder, and sets off in a direction revealed by the diadem's wisdom, a path that promises survival.</p>

        <p class="slug">EXT. MIDDLE-EARTH - ROAD - MORNING</p>

        <p class="act">The next morning, Rumbleus Lupinhollow continues his journey, now riding a small PONY and accompanied by a DARK-HAIRED ELF on horseback, REGOLAS.</p>

        <p class="char">RUMBLEUS</p>

        <p class="dlog">You may leave me here, Regolas. Your people have done more than enough for me. With a full belly and replenished stores, I shall certainly be able to accomplish my quest.</p>

        <p class="char">REGOLAS</p>

        <p class="dlog">I feel it would be irresponsible to leave you here, Lupinhollow. These woods are not a welcoming place for a lone hobbit. I can accompany you at least as far as the Hazy Canyons.</p>

        <p class="act">Just then, a booming CRACK splits the air, revealing MOLLY THE RED, the wizard who sent Rumbleus on this quest, her anger palpable.</p>

        <p class="char">MOLLY THE RED</p>

        <p class="par">(bellowing)</p>

        <p class="dlog">LUPINHOLLOW! You have used the diadem for your own gain! Did I not warn you severely enough of the dangers? And now, I find you consorting with elves!</p>

        <p class="act">Furious, Molly raises her wand, and Regolas pulls back with his horse.</p>

        <p class="char">REGOLAS</p>

        <p class="par">(defensive)</p>

        <p class="dlog">I mean no harm, wizard. Perhaps you should keep better track of your footmen, as this one arrived at my doorstep half-dead!</p>

        <p class="act">Molly's rage intensifies.</p>

        <p class="char">MOLLY THE RED</p>

        <p class="par">(fuming)</p>

        <p class="dlog">He is not your concern, Elf! Be gone, if you care to live another century!</p>

        <p class="act">Regolas turns his horse reluctantly, preparing to depart.</p>

        <p class="char">REGOLAS</p>

        <p class="dlog">It looks like I am leaving you here, Lupinhollow. I wish you luck on your journey.</p>

        <p class="act">Rumbleus turns to face Molly, his expression apologetic.</p>

        <p class="char">RUMBLEUS</p>

        <p class="dlog">The diadem and the elf saved my life. I am sorry for disobeying, but it couldn't be helped!</p>

        <p class="act">Molly's anger subsides, her voice softening.</p>

        <p class="char">MOLLY THE RED</p>

        <p class="par">(repentant)</p>

        <p class="dlog">You do not understand the evil that you could have unleashed. I thought that I had chosen a hobbit worthy of this task. Tell me, Rumbleus, was I mistaken?</p>

        <p class="act">Rumbleus sits tall in his saddle, determined.</p>

        <p class="char">RUMBLEUS</p>

        <p class="par">(confident)</p>

        <p class="dlog">You were not mistaken. I will complete the mission to throw the diadem into the fires of Fiend. There will be no more slip-ups, I am certain.</p>

        <p class="act">Molly's demeanor softens further.</p>

        <p class="char">MOLLY THE RED</p>

        <p class="par">(reassured)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Good. The fate of the world rests in your furry hands, little one.</p>

        <p class="act">With those words, Molly disappears in a puff of red smoke, leaving Rumbleus to continue his perilous journey, his resolve unwavering.</p>
