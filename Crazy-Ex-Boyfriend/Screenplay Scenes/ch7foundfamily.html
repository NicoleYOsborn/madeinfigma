        <p class="act">The apartment living room, resembling Remus's place, is well-lit and cozy. All the furniture faces the studio audience. REMUS LUPIN, in a bathrobe, enters with a newspaper and a cup of coffee, a smile on his face.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(sighs contentedly)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Nothing like a quiet Sunday morning, where I can work on my crossword puzzle in peace.</p>

        <p class="act">Suddenly, the door bangs open, and in bursts TONKS and PETER.</p>

        <p class="sub">The audience cheers and applauds.</p>

        <p class="char">TONKS</p>

        <p class="par">(excitedly)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Hi, neighbor! We thought you must be lonely, so we came to keep you company!</p>

        <p class="char">PETER</p>

        <p class="par">(enthusiastic)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Yeah, we even brought breakfast tacos!</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(gruffly)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Well, I was just fine on my own, actually.</p>

        <p class="act">Remus catches a whiff of the tacos.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(relenting)</p>

        <p class="dlog">I suppose I could eat then. Alright, come on in.</p>

        <p class="act">Tonks and Peter have already made themselves at home on the couch.</p>

        <p class="sub">The audience responds with laughter.</p>

        <p class="char">PETER</p>

        <p class="par">(continuing an earlier conversation)</p>

        <p class="dlog">What I don't understand is how they expect us to believe that Master Splinter really just learned Ninjitsu from watching movies! In the cartoon series, he was an actual Ninja master from Japan before he got turned into a rat.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(perplexed)</p>

        <p class="dlog">What on earth is he talking about?</p>

        <p class="char">TONKS</p>

        <p class="dlog">The new Ninja Turtles movie. They cut out the story of Hamato Yoshi and Oroku Saki, and Splinter was just a sewer rat before he got oozed.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(mock-shocked)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Spoiler alert! But, I'm with Pete, that's sacrilege.</p>

        <p class="sub">The audience laughs.</p>

        <p class="act">As Peter munches on a taco, he gestures at Remus.</p>

        <p class="char">PETER</p>

        <p class="dlog">See? He gets it!</p>

        <p class="act">Remus laughs and returns to his crossword puzzle as Tonks and Peter chat away.</p>

        <p class="act">Suddenly, the doorbell rings, making Remus jump.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(curses)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Son of aâ€”</p>

        <p class="act">He discovers that his pencil poked through the paper.</p>

        <p class="sub">More laughter from the audience.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(annoyed)</p>

        <p class="dlog">What now?</p>

        <p class="act">MARLENE enters.</p>

        <p class="sub">The audience cheers and applauds.</p>

        <p class="char">MARLENE</p>

        <p class="par">(sing-song)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Remus! I have a surprise for you!</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(surprised)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Marlene?</p>

        <p class="act">DORCAS follows, with Marlene presenting her like a grand prize.</p>

        <p class="sub">The audience cheers enthusiastically.</p>

        <p class="char">DORCAS</p>

        <p class="par">(excited)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Remus, Darling! I'm in Hogsmeade for the day, and I just had to see my favorite Hogwarts alumnus!</p>

        <p class="act">Remus's face lights up when he sees her, and they hug joyfully.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(laughing)</p>

        <p class="dlog">I can't believe you didn't tell me you were coming! I'm not even dressed!</p>

        <p class="char">DORCAS</p>

        <p class="par">(dismissively)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Nonsense, you look... so very you.</p>

        <p class="sub">The audience chuckles.</p>

        <p class="char">TONKS</p>

        <p class="dlog">Help yourselves to some tacos!</p>

        <p class="act">Remus, still holding his newspaper, notices the hole in it, and tries to smooth it out.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(to the room at large)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Anybody know 'infamous island prison,' eight letters, starting with A?</p>

        <p class="act">Everyone looks deep in thought.</p>

        <p class="char">PETER</p>

        <p class="par">(thoughtful)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Azkaban?</p>

        <p class="act">Blank stares from the group.</p>

        <p class="char">TONKS</p>

        <p class="par">(skeptical)</p>

        <p class="dlog">What the hell is Azkaban? Is that even eight letters?</p>

        <p class="act">Dorcas comes to the rescue.</p>

        <p class="char">DORCAS</p>

        <p class="par">(proclaiming)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Alcatraz!</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(exclaiming)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Yes! That fits!</p>

        <p class="char">TONKS</p>

        <p class="par">(teasing)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Azkaban, really. What nonsense is that?</p>

        <p class="act">Peter shrugs.</p>

        <p class="sub">The audience laughs.</p>

        <p class="act">Remus chuckles as he fills in the answer. Then the door opens again, and HARRY runs in.</p>

        <p class="sub">Cheers from the audience.</p>

        <p class="char">HARRY</p>

        <p class="par">(excitedly)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Uncle Remus! We brought donuts!</p>

        <p class="act">He runs to Remus, who pats his head affectionately.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="dlog">Hi Harry!</p>

        <p class="act">LILY, JAMES, and MOLLY enter, and the friends greet each other excitedly.</p>

        <p class="sub">The audience applauds.</p>

        <p class="char">MOLLY</p>

        <p class="par">(sighs)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Helping these two find a house in a good school district is exhausting! But you can't beat the Sunday morning open houses!</p>

        <p class="act">She drops a box of donuts next to the tacos on the coffee table.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(to Lily)</p>

        <p class="dlog">So, did you have any luck?</p>

        <p class="act">James and Lily exchange a secret smile.</p>

        <p class="char">LILY</p>

        <p class="par">(excited)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Yes! We're going to look over the contract and sign it tomorrow!</p>

        <p class="char">JAMES</p>

        <p class="par">(enthusiastic)</p>

        <p class="dlog">The best part? It's only a few blocks from Sirius, so we can still hang out together all the time! You, too, of course, Remus.</p>

        <p class="act">SIRIUS enters.</p>

        <p class="char">SIRIUS</p>

        <p class="dlog">Did someone say my name? Ooh tacos and donuts!</p>

        <p class="sub">The audience cheers loudly as Sirius is greeted by his friends.</p>

        <p class="act">Sirius picks out a donut and sits next to James, chatting.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="par">(thinking)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Hmm, last one and it's a long one. 'A group that is closely bonded by choice, not blood.' Eleven letters.</p>

        <p class="act">Everyone is quiet, pondering the crossword clue.</p>

        <p class="char">PETER</p>

        <p class="par">(realization)</p>

        <p class="dlog">Found Family.</p>

        <p class="sub">The audience responds with an 'awww' sound.</p>

        <p class="char">REMUS</p>

        <p class="dlog">Hey, has anyone seen Regulus?</p>

        <p class="act">Outro music plays as the group settles in, united by their found family bonds.</p>
