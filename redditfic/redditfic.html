            <p class="reddith1">Is my brothers’ friend mocking me?</p>
            <p>I (20m) come from a pretty large family, but I’ve never quite fit in with my brothers. Especially the
              twins, who are the closest to me in age (18m). You would never guess that we were born and raised in the
              same family, as we couldn’t be more different. I’m constantly subjected to their mockery and a relentless
              barrage of new spells and enchanted objects designed to torment me.</br>

              It has only increased as my important Ministry job is now allowing me to work from home three days a week,
              and my brothers have left school and are around most of the time. They are working on their own
              “business”— if you can call it that. Essentially, they’re making ludicrous, nonsensical products and
              peddling them to unsuspecting young wizards.</br>

              Of course, who else will they test their misspelling Quills on? They find it hilarious when I send memos
              to a very important Government Official with misspelled words. (I unintentionally called her “Miss
              Umbitch” thanks to them, and had to apologize profusely. It’s a miracle that I am still employed!) And
              they laughed uproariously when I went to add protein powder to my smoothie and mistakenly opened one of
              their “joke” products, which erupted, covering me in bubotuber puss.</br>

              Normally, I am able to just brush it off when only my family is around to witness it. But recently their
              friend L (19m) has been spending a lot of time at our home helping them with their marketing
              campaign.</br>

              L is one of those people who has natural charm and charisma, so everyone instantly likes him. As someone
              who has the charisma of a soggy cabbage sandwich, I have always fount him a bit intimidating. But when we
              were in school he never paid attention to me. He would laugh along with my brothers when they teased me,
              but we didn’t interact much otherwise.</br>

              He has been acting different toward me recently, though. My girlfriend and I split up early in the summer,
              and surprisingly, L had my back when my brothers gave me a hard time about it. He scolded them for being
              uncaring and even offered to make me a cup of tea. When he was a guest in our house! For once, my brothers
              were speechless, but I declined his offer and remained in my room for the rest of the afternoon.</br>

              Since that day, if I walk in to a room when L is present, they go silent and gawk at me while L tries to
              engage me in conversation and my brothers exchange amused glances. I get flustered by his questions, so I
              give curt responses and escape the situation as quickly as possible.</br>

              Oh! When the bubotubor puss exploded on me, L was the only one who did not find it humourous, and actually
              hurried over to help me clean it up! My brothers stayed back, choking on their laughter and whispering to
              each other the entire time.</br>

              I’ve always envied my brothers for their friendship with someone like L, but I worry that I am fooling
              myself when I think that he might want to be my friend. What if it’s all a big prank just meant to
              humiliate me?

                  <p class="redditcommenttext">There’s not nearly enough info here to make a judgement call. When you
                    say
                    strict do you mean he grounded you for swearing or do you mean he hit you? From what you’ve said it
                    sounds like this stems from you being closer to your dad than your brother was and his jealousy is
                    playing out in weird ways. I get why you don’t want to speak ill of the dead especially after they
                    died for you and it’s not your fault your brother has unresolved issues with your dad.</p>

                          <p class="redditcommenttext">Wait, so are you saying your dad used to hurt only YOU? And
                            you’re
                            upset that your brother didn’t immediately valorize the man when he died? Ok, this is above
                            reddit’s paygrade. Your dad was definitely abusive and if you’re downplaying him hitting you
                            then there’s definitely other abuse that your brother hasn’t forgiven him for and you
                            haven’t
                            realized is abuse. See a therapist.</p>
